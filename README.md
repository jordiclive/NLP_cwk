This repo and paper:  https://github.com/dora-tang/SemEval-2020-Task-7, seems to have a  decent approach for the embedding one. Not sure if should use sentencepiece at the start, or some BPE.

I think they won't really look at the code, just the report. 
I imagine its quite a lot about the non-embedding approach.
